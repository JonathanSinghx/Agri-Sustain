        <!-- Introduction -->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Food waste is a global issue with serious environmental, economic, and social consequences. By taking conscious steps to reduce food waste, individuals can contribute to a more sustainable future. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to help you minimize food waste in your daily life.</p>

        <section>
            <!-- Step 1: Plan Your Meals and Shopping -->
            <h3>Step 1: Plan Your Meals and Shopping</h3>
            <h4>Create a Weekly Meal Plan</h4>
            <p>Before heading to the grocery store, plan your meals for the week. Take inventory of what you already have and build your shopping list accordingly.</p>

            <h4>Stick to Your List</h4>
            <p>When shopping, stick to your list and avoid impulse purchases. This reduces the chance of buying items you won't use.</p>

            <h4>Buy in Bulk with Caution</h4>
            <p>While buying in bulk can save money, be cautious with perishable items. Only buy in bulk if you can consume or store the items effectively.</p>

            <!-- Step 2: Proper Storage -->
            <h3>Step 2: Proper Storage</h3>
            <h4>Organize Your Fridge</h4>
            <p>Store food based on its expiration date. Place older items in the front for easy access. Use clear containers to see what's inside, reducing the risk of forgotten items.</p>

            <h4>Understand Food Labels</h4>
            <p>Learn to read food labels. "Sell by," "use by," and "best before" dates have different meanings. Use your senses to determine freshness; trust your nose and taste.</p>

            <h4>Invest in Food Storage Containers</h4>
            <p>Use airtight containers to store leftovers and extend their freshness. Label containers with dates to keep track of freshness.</p>

            <!-- Step 3: Mindful Cooking and Portion Control -->
            <h3>Step 3: Mindful Cooking and Portion Control</h3>
            <h4>Cook Wisely</h4>
            <p>Plan your portions to avoid cooking excess food. Use recipes that allow for easy scaling to match your needs.</p>

            <h4>Use Leftovers Creatively</h4>
            <p>Turn leftovers into new meals. For example, yesterday's roasted vegetables can become a tasty omelet today. Get creative with soups, stews, and sandwiches.</p>

            <!-- Step 4: Reduce Plate Waste -->
            <h3>Step 4: Reduce Plate Waste</h3>
            <h4>Portion Control</h4>
            <p>Serve smaller portions to minimize plate waste. You can always go back for seconds. Encourage your family or guests to do the same.</p>

            <h4>Eat Your Leftovers</h4>
            <p>Make a habit of finishing your plate. If you can't, save leftovers for later. Share extra food with those in need or compost if possible.</p>

            <!-- Step 5: Composting -->
            <h3>Step 5: Composting</h3>
            <h4>Set Up a Compost Bin</h4>
            <p>Create a composting system to recycle food scraps and organic waste. Compost enriches your garden soil and diverts waste from land

                <h4>Learn What You Can Compost</h4>
            <p>Compost fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and yard waste. Avoid composting meat, dairy, and oily foods, as they can attract pests.</p>

            <!-- Step 6: Stay Informed -->
            <h3>Step 6: Stay Informed</h3>
            <h4>Be Informed</h4>
            <p>Stay updated on food waste issues and solutions. Participate in local initiatives and organizations that work to reduce food waste.</p>

            <h4>Educate Others</h4>
            <p>Share your knowledge with friends and family to create a collective effort. Encourage others to join you in reducing food waste.</p>
